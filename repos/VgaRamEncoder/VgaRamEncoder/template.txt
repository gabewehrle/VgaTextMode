This is the VGA Ram Encoder template file. This file outlines what input the
VGA Ram Encoder supports. In its simplest form, a plain text, UTF-8 encoded text
file can be encoded. However, to take full advantage of all the features of VGA
text mode, two different escape sequences are supported:

To change foreground and background color, use a backslash followed by '^'.
Then, specify two hex digits. The first digit specifies the foreground color,
and the second specifies the background. For example:

\^47This text is red on white.\^0x70This text is white on black. No space is needed after
the escape sequence. The hex literal may be proceeded by '0x', but is not
necessary.

A character can also be specified using a hex, decimal, or binary literal.
For example:
\0x40 <- This is '@' using hex. \0d64 <- This is '@' using decimal.
\0b01000000 <- This is '@' using binary (all 8 digits do not need to be included).

Each line can be a maximum of 80 characters long, and the file can have a max of
30 rows. However, notice how escape sequences for colors do not count against
the character limit. Additionally, character escape sequences only count against
the limit by 1.

Here's information regarding how the default color pallette is mapped:
 0x00 | 0x01 | 0x02 | 0x03 | 0x04 | 0x05 | 0x06 | 0x07 |
 Black| Blue | Green| Cyan | Red  | Pink |Yellow| White|

The next 8 colors are lower intensity versions of the first 8.
