    Hello, world! This is 80 by 30 text mode! A standard 16 color pallette is
supported which includes the three primary colors Red, Green, and Blue, their
complementary colors, plus black and white. These 8 colors are also provided in
a darker shade, providing 16 total colors. These colors can be used as either a
foreground or background color. A 4kb glyph rom contains the font you're reading
now and supports 256 different characters. Fun fact: the default font displayed
is the same font used by the IBM XT BIOS! This default text that is being
printed is specified in an initialization file which is written to the character
frame buffer on startup.

    The character frame buffer is layed out as following:

                                    +0   +0    +1
                                   _______________
                            0x00  | FG | BG | CHAR
                            0x02  | FG | BG | CHAR

    The foreground and background color take up 4 bits each for a total of 1
byte. The character code takes up a full byte. This means that each character
takes up a total of 2 bytes. In 80x30 mode, this means that 4.8kb are needed
to store the whole frame. The glyph rom is layed out as shown:

                 +0     +1     +2     +3     +4     +5    ...   +15
               ______________________________________________________
        0x00  | ROW0 | ROW1 | ROW2 | ROW3 | ROW4 | ROW5 | ... | ROW15
        0x10  | ROW0 | ROW1 | ROW2 | ROW3 | ROW4 | ROW5 | ... | ROW15

    Each glyph takes up 16 bytes, with each byte making up 1 of the 16 rows of
the glyph.
